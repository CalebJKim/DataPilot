Bigger may not mean better

Large vehicles dominate U.S. auto showrooms and highways alike. SUVs and crossovers are extremely popular: Together, they command around 50% market share for all passenger vehicles sold in the U.S.[1] Automakers’ decisions to eliminate sedans from their lineups reflect this statistic—and may cause disaster for other drivers and pedestrians by putting larger, heavier vehicles on the road.

We surveyed more than 1,500 Americans to determine their feelings on vehicle safety. The results show:

Americans feel safest in SUVs compared to other vehicles.

Women felt 3.5x safer in SUVs than pickup trucks compared to men.

Men were nearly twice as likely to feel safest in pickup trucks compared to women.

Below, we’ll explore how the average car size is increasing, our survey findings, and whether SUVs pose a threat to pedestrians and smaller cars.

Average car size varies by vehicle type

Many factors, like passenger space and safety features, lead to design changes that increase a vehicle’s length, width, or height.

Average car length

According to Car Roar, the average car is 14.7 feet long (approximately a Nissan Versa sedan).[2]

The shortest car in the U.S. is the Chevrolet Spark (≤ 12 feet long).

The longest passenger car is the Rolls-Royce Phantom (long-wheelbase version, ≈ 20 feet long).

The longest noncommercial vehicle is the Ford Super Duty line of pickup trucks (≥ 22 feet long).

Average car width

According to VEHQ, the average width of a car is 5.8 feet.[3]

The narrowest car is the Chevrolet Spark (5.2 feet wide).

The widest non-luxury vehicle is the Tesla Model X (7.4 feet wide).

The widest vehicle overall is the Ram 3500 dual rear wheel truck (8.7 feet wide without mirrors).

Average car size is growing to match demand

American cars are built larger than their international counterparts. This trend is fueled by consumer demand and shifts in market strategy:

In 2019, U.S. automakers phased out small cars and sedans due to declining sales.[4]

Vehicles like the Toyota Camry, Ford F-150, and Toyota RAV4 have grown larger with every redesign.



SUVs are more desirable than ever—but at what cost?

Our survey found that 50% of respondents felt safest in SUVs.

SUVs, however, are prone to rollover accidents, which account for one-fifth of all fatal crashes in the U.S.[5]

The IIHS reports that driver deaths in small cars are twice as likely as in larger ones.[6]

While SUVs dominate the market, they complicate efforts to regulate fuel emissions. Cities like New York are exploring congestion tolls based on vehicle size, as seen in Paris and London.[7]

Pedestrian safety: compromised in an SUV world

Fatal pedestrian accidents involving SUVs increased by 81% between 2009 and 2016. SUVs remain twice as likely as cars to kill pedestrians in collisions.[8]



Many SUVs feature high hoods, increasing risks to pedestrians. While some manufacturers have adapted their designs, pedestrians should remain cautious:

Always cross at crosswalks.

Avoid distractions (headphones, phones) near moving vehicles.[9]

Pickup trucks: popular but seen as untrustworthy

While pickup trucks remain the most popular vehicles in the U.S., our survey found:

Men are far more likely to feel safest in pickups.

Only 16% of women view pickups as the safest option.[11]



Conclusion

Whether you drive an SUV, truck, or small car:

SUV and pickup truck drivers must be aware of blind spots.

Pedestrians and small car drivers should exercise caution around larger vehicles.

The majority of vehicles on U.S. roads will likely be utility vehicles in a few years.[1] Regardless of the vehicle size, always drive defensively and stay alert.
