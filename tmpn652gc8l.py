# Since the SQL results and web sentiments are empty, we won't create any plots.
# However, if there were data, here is how you would go about generating visualizations.
# Placeholder code to represent the structure of the intended visualizations.

# For SQL Results (No data to visualize)

# For Web Sentiments (No data to visualize)

# Example code if there were data
# sentiments = []  # placeholder for sentiment data
# positive_count = sum(1 for sentiment in sentiments if sentiment == 'positive')
# negative_count = sum(1 for sentiment in sentiments if sentiment == 'negative')
# neutral_count = sum(1 for sentiment in sentiments if sentiment == 'neutral')

# sentiment_labels = ['Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral']
# sentiment_counts = [positive_count, negative_count, neutral_count]

# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# sns.barplot(x=sentiment_labels, y=sentiment_counts)
# plt.title('Sentiment Distribution')
# plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
# plt.ylabel('Count')
# plt.savefig('sentiment_distribution.png')
# plt.close()

# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# plt.pie(sentiment_counts, labels=sentiment_labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
# plt.title('Sentiment Proportions')
# plt.savefig('sentiment_proportions.png')
# plt.close()
